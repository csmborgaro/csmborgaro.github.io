The Discord Chatbot project is an AI-integrated chatbot that I developed as a personal project to enhance user engagement and interaction. This project allowed me to learn how to create dynamic and interactive features within a chatbot environment.

The chatbot is implemented using [Python](https://python.org) and the [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) library. Within a few weeks, I developed a range of features, including personalized conversations tailored to users' preferences and interests.

One key feature is the bot's ability to perform image manipulation using the [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) library, which creates personalized "thank you" notifications for users who boost the server. Additionally, the bot can respond to requests for endearments, such as sending a goodnight kiss with an image and mentioning the user.

For those who enjoy roleplaying, the chatbot can engage in various scenarios, adding a fun and interactive element to the user experience. This project showcases the integration of AI to create a dynamic and engaging environment for Discord users.

In this project, I gained experience with various tools and technologies, including:
- Programming languages: Python
- Libraries: Discord.py, Pillow
- Frameworks: Flask
- Development environments: aiohttp

This project not only demonstrates the potential of AI in enhancing user engagement but also provided valuable hands-on experience with chatbot development and AI integration.

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
